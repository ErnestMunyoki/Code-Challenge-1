# Code-Challenge-1
This repository contains solutions to a series of JavaScript coding challenges. Each challenge is organized into its own dedicated folder within the main repository to ensure clarity and modularity. 
Each coding challenge has a separate folder named appropriately to reflect the challenge it contains.
This structure promotes easy navigation and maintenance, making it straightforward to locate and work on individual challenges independently.
